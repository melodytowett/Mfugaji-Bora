                <h3>How to feed dairy cows for high milk production</h3>
               <p>Under nearly all practical management conditions, dairy cows and growing dairy heifers are fed ad lib. <br>Thus, voluntary feed intake is the major limitation to nutrient supply in dairy cattle.<br> Feed intake is usually characterized as dry matter intake (DMI) to compare diets of variable moisture concentrations. <br>
                DMI is affected by both animal and feed factors. Body size, milk production, <br>and stage of lactation or gestation are the major animal factors.</p>
                <p>Energy requirements for lactating dairy cows are met primarily by carbohydrate fractions of the diet. <br>These consist of fibrous and nonfibrous carbohydrates.<br> Fibrous carbohydrate proportions are generally measured as NDF and expressed as a percentage of dry matter.<br>
                     Nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC) proportions are calculated by subtracting <br>the proportions (as dry matter) of NDF, crude protein, fat, and ash from 100%. Nonfiber</p>

                <h3>Beef cattle too needs to be taken careof <br>as much as we do to dairy cattle</h3>
                <p>Beef cattle production, whether on range, improved pasture, or in the feedlot, <br>is most economic when feedstuffs are used effectively.<br> Young growing grass or other high-quality pasture crops usually supply ample nutrients, <br>
                    such that mature and young growing cattle can consume sufficient good-quality <br>mixed pasture (grasses and legumes) for normal growth and maintenance. <br>However, mature pasture, crop residues, or forage crops harvested in <br>a manner that results in shattering, leaching, or spoilage may be <br>
                    so reduced in nutritive value (particularly energy, protein, phosphorus, and provitamin A or β-carotene) that they are <br>suitable only in a maintenance ration for adult cattle. Such feedstuffs should be supplemented if used for any other purposes.</p>
